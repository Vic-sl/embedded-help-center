# embedded-help-center

This is a community Q&A and experience sharing platform for embedded developers.

We use GitHub as the base platform, and encourage developers to raise questions through issues, discuss solution ideas, and organise the final solutions into documents and archive them in the repository, forming a continuously improved "technical knowledge base"
